Bike Share Data

### Description
This project is an interactive experience, so that the user can learn descriptive statistics of a Bicycle-sharing system called "Bike Share", which takes place in the cities of Washington, Chicago and New York City.

**1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

- Most common month
- Most common day of week
- Most common hour of day

**2 Popular stations and trip**

- Most common start station
- Most common end station
- Most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**3 Trip duration**

- Total travel time
- Average travel time

**4 User info**

- Counts of each user type
- Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
